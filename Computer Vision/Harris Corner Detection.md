# 🟦 Harris Corner and Edge Detector🟦

## 📝 **Overview**

The Harris Corner and Edge Detector, introduced by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988, is a foundational computer vision technique for detecting corners and edges in images. It was designed to support robust feature tracking, especially in unconstrained 3D scenes, by providing reliable, discrete features for tasks like motion analysis and 3D reconstruction.

## 🎯 **Motivation & Problem Statement**

- **Goal:** Enable robust 3D interpretation of complex, natural scenes (e.g., roads, buildings, trees) using monocular image sequences.
    
- **Challenge:**
    
    - Traditional edge-based tracking is unreliable due to issues like the aperture problem and the difficulty of matching curved or fragmented edges across frames.
        
    - Feature-points/corners are discrete and trackable but lack the connectivity needed for higher-level scene understanding.
        
- **Solution:** Combine edge and corner detection to create a richer, more consistent feature representation for tracking and scene reconstruction.

## 🏗️ **Key Concepts**

## **1. Corners vs. Edges**

- **Corner:** A point where two dominant edges meet; high information content and easy to track across frames.
    
- **Edge:** A line of abrupt intensity change; provides connectivity but is harder to match due to fragmentation and the aperture problem.
    

## **2. Moravec’s Corner Detector (Predecessor)**

- Slides a window over the image and measures intensity changes for discrete shifts.
    
- **Problems:**
    
    - Anisotropic (only considers certain directions).
        
    - Noisy (uses a binary window).
        
    - Overly sensitive to edges.

## 🧮 **Harris Operator: Mathematical Formulation**

## **Auto-correlation Function**

- Measures how the intensity of a window changes with small shifts in any direction.
    
- For a shift `(x,y)`:
    
$$
E(x, y) = \sum_{u,v} w(u,v) \left[ I(u+x, v+y) - I(u, v) \right]^2
$$
>	where `w(u,v)` is a window function (preferably Gaussian for smoothness)
## **Taylor Expansion (for small shifts)**

- Expands `E(x,y)` to a quadratic form:
    
$$
E(x, y) \approx A x^2 + 2C x y + B y^2
$$
    
    where:
$$
A = \sum w(u,v) I_x^2 
$$
$$B = \sum w(u,v) I_y^2 
$$
$$C = \sum w(u,v) I_x I_y
$$   
- This leads to a 2x2 **structure matrix** MM:
$$
			M = \begin{bmatrix} A & C \\ C & B \end{bmatrix}
$$
## **Eigenvalue Analysis**

- Let `α, β` be the eigenvalues of `M`:
    
    - **Flat region:**  `α ≈ β ≈ 0`
        
    - **Edge:** One large, one small (`α ≫ β` or vice versa)
        
    - **Corner:** Both large (`α, β` large)
        

## **Corner Response Function**

- To avoid explicit eigenvalue computation, use:
$$
R = \det(M) - k \cdot [\operatorname{Tr}(M)]^2
$$

$$
\operatorname{Tr}(M) = \alpha + \beta = A + B 
$$$$
\det(M) = \alpha \beta = AB - C^2
$$
    - `k` is an empirical constant (typically `0.04 ≤ k ≤ 0.06` )
        
- **Interpretation:**
    
    - `R > 0`: Corner
        
    - `R < 0`: Edge
        
    - `R ≈ 0`: Flat region

## 🛠️ **Algorithm Steps**

1. **Smooth the image** (e.g., Gaussian blur) to reduce noise.
    
2. **Compute image gradients**.
    
3. **Form the structure matrix** `M` at each pixel.
    
4. **Calculate the corner response** `R` for each pixel.
    
5. **Non-maximum suppression:** Retain only local maxima of `R` as corner points.
    
6. **Thresholding:** Discard weak responses.
    
7. **Edge/corner linking:** Optionally, connect edges to corners for structural representation.

## 🚦 **Advantages & Innovations**

- **Rotationally Invariant:** Uses eigenvalues or trace/determinant, so results are independent of orientation.
    
- **Combines Edge and Corner Detection:** Enables richer scene representation.
    
- **Robust to Noise:** Gaussian smoothing and structure matrix formulation improve reliability.
    
- **Repeatability:** Good performance under changing illumination and rotation.

## ⚖️ **Limitations & Considerations**

- **Parameter Sensitivity:** Choice of window size, kk, and thresholds affect performance.
    
- **Not Scale-Invariant:** Original formulation does not handle multi-scale features (addressed in later extensions).
    
- **Edge/Corner Ambiguity:** Some regions may be ambiguously classified, especially in textured areas.
