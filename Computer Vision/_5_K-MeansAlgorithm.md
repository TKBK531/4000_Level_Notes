## üîπ **Step 1: Understand the Background**

### 1.1 Read the Research Article

- **Article:** ‚ÄúData Clustering: 50 Years Beyond K-Means‚Äù by Prof. Anil K. Jain.
    
- **Goal:** Understand the history, strengths, weaknesses, and variations of k-means.
    
- **Take Notes On:**
    
    - Basic k-means algorithm
        
    - Problems with initialization
        
    - Comparison with other clustering methods
        
    - Evaluation techniques (e.g., purity, silhouette score)

## üîπ **Step 2: Prepare the Data**

### 2.1 Load and Understand the Dataset

- Use the `iris.txt` file.
    
- **Data contains:**
    
    - 4 numeric attributes: `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`
        
    - 1 categorical label: species (`Iris-setosa`, `Iris-versicolor`, `Iris-virginica`)
        

### 2.2 Preprocessing

- Remove the label column for clustering.
    
- Normalize/standardize the numeric data (optional but recommended for better clustering).
    

---

## üîπ **Step 3: Implement K-Means Algorithm**

### 3.1 Define the Algorithm Steps

- Choose `k = 3` (since there are 3 species).
    
- Randomly initialize 3 centroids.
    
- Assign each point to the nearest centroid (based on Euclidean distance).
    
- Recompute centroids based on cluster assignments.
    
- Repeat until centroids stabilize or a max iteration is reached.
    

---

## üîπ **Step 4: Visualize and Analyze Results**

### 4.1 Plot Intermediate Results

- After each iteration (or selected iterations), plot clusters to show how they evolve.
    
- Use color-coding to represent cluster membership.
    

### 4.2 Final Result

- Show final cluster assignments.
    
- Overlay actual species (ground truth) using different shapes or borders.
    

---

## üîπ **Step 5: Evaluate the Clustering**

### 5.1 Match Clusters to Species

- Compare cluster labels to actual species labels.
    
- Compute accuracy or cluster purity.
    
- Make a confusion matrix to visualize alignment.
    

---

## üîπ **Step 6: Answer the Given Questions**

### Q1: **How well does the clustering match the species?**

- Discuss:
    
    - Accuracy (e.g., % correctly clustered)
        
    - Which species were well-separated (e.g., Setosa is typically well-separated)
        
    - Which were confused (e.g., Versicolor and Virginica)
        

### Q2: **What alternatives can reduce sensitivity to initialization?**

- Common approaches:
    
    - **K-Means++:** Better initialization strategy to choose starting centroids.
        
    - **Multiple Runs:** Run k-means multiple times and choose the best result (lowest inertia).
        
    - **Hierarchical Clustering Initialization:** Use dendrogram to select initial centroids.
        
    - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Probabilistic clustering method.
        
    - **Density-Based Methods (e.g., DBSCAN):** Avoids k-means initialization issues entirely.

#### *When applying the k-means clustering algorithm for a given set of data points, if different starting positions were used for the centers in separate instances, will the algorithm always converge to the same solution? Explain your answer*

### üîπ **Explanation**

#### 1. **K-Means is Sensitive to Initialization**

- K-means starts with randomly chosen initial centroids.
    
- The clustering result depends heavily on this starting point.
    
- Different initial centroids can lead to different local minima of the objective function (sum of squared distances from points to their assigned centroid).
    

#### 2. **Non-Convex Objective Function**

- The objective function minimized by k-means (within-cluster sum of squares) is **non-convex**.
    
- This means it can have **multiple local minima**.
    
- Depending on the starting positions, k-means may converge to **different local minima**.
    

#### 3. **Convergence is Guaranteed, But Not to a Global Optimum**

- The algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite number of steps.
    
- However, this convergence is typically to a **local** minimum, **not necessarily the global** one.
    

---

### üîπ **Example**

If you run k-means on the same dataset multiple times with different random initializations, you might get:

- Different cluster assignments
    
- Different final centroids
    
- Different values of the clustering cost (inertia)
    

---

### üîπ **Conclusion**

So, **k-means does not always converge to the same solution** with different initializations. To address this:

- Use better initialization methods like **k-means++**.
    
- Run the algorithm multiple times and choose the result with the **lowest cost**.
