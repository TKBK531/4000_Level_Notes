#### **Introduction to Computer Vision**

- **Computer Vision**: A field focused on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world, emulating human vision.
    
- **Key Goals**: Learning, making inferences, and taking actions based on visual inputs.
    
- **Related Fields**:
    
    - **Image Processing**: Low-level operations to transform images (e.g., enhancing images for further processing).
        
    - **Image Analysis/Understanding**: Extracting information and making decisions based on images.
        
    - **Computer Graphics**: Generating images from descriptions (inverse of computer vision).
        
    - **Machine Vision**: Often used in industrial applications for automated inspection and control.
        

#### **Human vs. Computer Vision**

- **Human Vision**: Effortlessly perceives 3D structures, interprets scenes, and understands context.
    
- **Computer Vision**: Mimics human vision using sensors (cameras) and interpreting devices (algorithms) to analyze and understand visual data.
    

#### **Challenges in Computer Vision**

- **Inverse Problem**: Recovering unknowns from insufficient information (e.g., inferring 3D structure from 2D images).
    
- **Complexity**: Vision is difficult due to variations in lighting, texture, shape, and spatial relationships.
    

#### **Key Components of Computer Vision**

1. **Sensing**: How sensors capture images and encode properties of the world (e.g., material, shape, illumination).
    
2. **Encoding Information**: Extracting 3D world information from 2D images (e.g., geometry, texture, motion, object identity).
    
3. **Representations**: Storing descriptions of objects, their parts, properties, and relationships.
    
4. **Algorithms**: Developing methods to process image information and construct descriptions of the world.
