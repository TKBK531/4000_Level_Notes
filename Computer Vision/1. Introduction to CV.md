#### **Introduction to Computer Vision**

- **Computer Vision**: A field focused on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world, emulating human vision.
    
- **Key Goals**: Learning, making inferences, and taking actions based on visual inputs.
    
- **Related Fields**:
    
    - **Image Processing**: Low-level operations to transform images (e.g., enhancing images for further processing).
        
    - **Image Analysis/Understanding**: Extracting information and making decisions based on images.
        
    - **Computer Graphics**: Generating images from descriptions (inverse of computer vision).
        
    - **Machine Vision**: Often used in industrial applications for automated inspection and control.
        

#### **Human vs. Computer Vision**

- **Human Vision**: Effortlessly perceives 3D structures, interprets scenes, and understands context.
    
- **Computer Vision**: Mimics human vision using sensors (cameras) and interpreting devices (algorithms) to analyze and understand visual data.
    

#### **Challenges in Computer Vision**

- **Inverse Problem**: Recovering unknowns from insufficient information (e.g., inferring 3D structure from 2D images).
    
- **Complexity**: Vision is difficult due to variations in lighting, texture, shape, and spatial relationships.
    

#### **Key Components of Computer Vision**

1. **Sensing**: How sensors capture images and encode properties of the world (e.g., material, shape, illumination).
    
2. **Encoding Information**: Extracting 3D world information from 2D images (e.g., geometry, texture, motion, object identity).
    
3. **Representations**: Storing descriptions of objects, their parts, properties, and relationships.
    
4. **Algorithms**: Developing methods to process image information and construct descriptions of the world.

**I. Core Definitions & Relationships**

- **Image Processing:** Performing basic operations on images to transform them into other images, primarily to enhance them for further processing. This is considered low-level processing.
    
- **Image Analysis / Image Understanding:**
    - **Image Analysis:** Extracting information from images (mid-level processing).
        
    - **Image Understanding:** Making decisions based on images.
        
- **Computer Vision:** Using computers to emulate human vision, involving learning, making inferences, and taking actions based on visual inputs. It is a rapidly growing field focused on teaching computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world.
    
- **Machine Vision:** (Not explicitly defined in the provided text beyond being a term for understanding).
- **Computer Graphics:** Strongly related to computer vision, both concerned with how objects are viewed and modeled.
    
    - **Computer Vision:** Focuses on the description and recognition of objects from images.
        
    - **Computer Graphics:** Focuses on the generation of images from descriptions.
        
    - **Relationship Diagram:** Images (2D) undergo image processing, leading to vision (description and recognition). Geometry (3D shape) combined with photometry (appearance) leads to graphics (image generation).
        

**II. Human vs. Computer Vision System**

- **Human Vision System:** Comprises the Eye (sensing device for capturing images) and the Brain (interpreting device for understanding content). Humans easily perceive the 3D structure of the world.
    
- **Computer Vision System:** Analogously uses a Sensing device (input) and an Interpreting device (output) to identify image content (e.g., "bowl, oranges, bananas, lemons, peaches").
    

**III. Challenges in Computer Vision**

- **Inverse Problem:** Vision is difficult because it's an inverse problem; it seeks to recover unknowns given insufficient information to fully specify the solution.
    
- **Key Challenges:**
