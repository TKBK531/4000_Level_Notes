### **ðŸ“Œ Abstract**

**Summary**:  
VMware FT is aÂ **fault-tolerant system**Â for virtual machines (VMs) that replicates the execution of a primary VM on a backup VM, ensuring continuity with <10% performance overhead and <20 Mbit/s bandwidth usage. It uses deterministic replay to synchronize VMs and handles practical challenges like failure detection, split-brain avoidance, and automatic redundancy restoration.

**Key Points**:

- ðŸŽ¯Â **Primary/Backup Model**: Backup VM mirrors primary VM in virtual lockstep.

- ðŸ”„Â **Deterministic Replay**: Captures non-deterministic events (e.g., interrupts) to ensure identical execution.
    
- ðŸ“‰Â **Low Overhead**: Minimal performance impact and bandwidth usage.

### **ðŸ“Œ 1. Introduction**

**Problem**:  
Traditional fault tolerance requires replicating all state changes (CPU, memory, I/O), which is bandwidth-intensive.

**Solution**:

- **State-machine approach**: Model VMs as deterministic state machines; sync via inputs/non-deterministic events.
- **Hypervisor advantage**: Captures all VM operations, enabling precise replay.
- **Focus**: Fail-stop failures (detectable crashes).

**Novelty**:
- Commercial, low-overhead FT forÂ **any x86 OS/application**.
- Uni-processor support (multi-processor challenges remain).

### **ðŸ“Œ 2. Basic FT Design**

#### **2.1 Configuration**
- **Primary VM**: Handles all external I/O (network, disk).
- **Backup VM**: Receives inputs via logging channel; no external output.
- **Shared Storage**: Virtual disks on shared storage (e.g., iSCSI).

#### **2.2 Deterministic Replay**
- LogsÂ **non-deterministic events**Â (interrupts, inputs) during primary execution.
- Backup replays logs to stay in sync.
- No "epochs" (unlike prior work); events replayed at exact instruction points.

#### **2.3 FT Protocol**
**Output Requirement**: Backup must be consistent with all primary outputs after failover.  
**Output Rule**:
- Primary delays external output until backup acknowledges the associated log entry.
- Ensures backup can reproduce primaryâ€™s state at output point.

**Example**:
- Primary sends network packet â†’ logs event â†’ waits for backup ACK â†’ sends packet.

#### **2.4 Failure Detection & Response**
- **Heartbeats + Log Traffic Monitoring**: Timeout â†’ failover.
- **Split-Brain Prevention**:
    - Atomic test-and-set on shared storage to elect new primary.
    - Failed VM "commits suicide" if storage access fails.

- **Redundancy Restoration**: Automatically spawns new backup post-failure.-

### **ðŸ“Œ 3. Practical Implementation**

#### **3.1 Starting/Restarting Backup VMs**
- **FT VMotion**: Clones running primary VM to backup host with <1s pause.
- **Cluster Management**: Chooses backup host based on resource availability.

#### **3.2 Logging Channel Management**

- **Flow Control**:
    - Primary pauses if log buffer fills (backup too slow).
    - Backup pauses if log buffer empties.

- **Lag Control**: Slows primary CPU if backup lags >1s.

#### **3.3 Disk I/O Handling**
- **Races**: Detect and serialize conflicting disk/memory accesses.
- **Bounce Buffers**: Temporary buffers for DMA to avoid non-determinism.
- **Post-Failover**: Re-issue pending disk IOs (idempotent).

#### **3.4 Network I/O Optimizations**
- Disable async network updates â†’ trap to hypervisor for logging.
- **Optimizations**:
    - Batch packet transmits/interrupts.
    - Deferred execution to reduce ACK latency.

### **ðŸ“Œ 4. Design Alternatives**

#### **4.1 Shared vs. Non-Shared Disk**

- **Shared Disk**:
    
    - Simpler; writes delayed per Output Rule.
        
- **Non-Shared Disk**:
    
    - Backup writes to its own disk; no Output Rule delay.
        
    - Requires disk sync on startup/failure.
        
    - Useful for long-distance FT (no shared storage).
        

#### **4.2 Backup Disk Reads**

- **Default**: Primary sends disk read data via logging channel.
    
- **Alternative**: Backup executes reads locally.
    
    - **Pros**: Reduces logging bandwidth.
        
    - **Cons**: Slight throughput drop (1â€“4%); complex error handling.

### **ðŸ“Œ 5. Performance Evaluation**

#### **5.1 Benchmarks**

|Workload|FT Overhead|Log Bandwidth|
|---|---|---|
|SPECJbb2005|2%|1.5 Mbit/s|
|Oracle Swingbench|1%|12 Mbit/s|
|MS-SQL DVD Store|6%|18 Mbit/s|

- **Idle VMs**: 0.5â€“1.5 Mbit/s (timer interrupts dominate).
    

#### **5.2 Network Benchmarks**

- **1 Gbit/s Logging**:
    
    - Receive: 604 Mbit/s (bottlenecked by logging).
        
    - Transmit: 855 Mbit/s (lower logging needs).
        
- **10 Gbit/s Logging**: Near-line rates for both.
