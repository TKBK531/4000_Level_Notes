#### **1. File Systems Basics**

- **Definition**: A method to organize, store, and retrieve data on storage devices.

- **Key Functions**:
    - **File Organization**: Hierarchical directories for structured access.
    - **Storage Management**: Splits files into blocks/sectors for efficient storage.
    - **Metadata**: Stores file name, size, permissions, etc.
    - **Access Control**: Manages read/write/execute permissions.
    - **Retrieval**: Uses indexing and directories for efficient access.

- **Components**:
    - **Flat File Service**: Manages file operations via Unique File Identifiers (UFIDs).
    - **Directory Service**: Maps text names to UFIDs.
    - **Client Module**: Integrates file and directory services for user applications.

#### **2. Distributed File Systems (DFS)**

- **Definition**: A system allowing file access across multiple machines, appearing as a local file system.

- **Key Features**:
    - **Transparency**: Location (users unaware of file location) and Access (standard system calls).
    - **Fault Tolerance**: Replication for data availability during failures.
    - **Scalability**: Adds nodes to handle growing data.
    - **Concurrency**: Supports simultaneous access/modification.

- **Examples**:
    - **NFS (Network File System)**: UNIX-based network file access.
    - **GFS (Google File System)**: Optimized for large files, replication, and a master-chunk architecture.
    - **HDFS (Hadoop DFS)**: Block-level storage, fault tolerance via replication, designed for big data.

- **Challenges**:
    - Data consistency, network latency, security, and fault recovery.

#### **3. Data Replication & Consistency**

- **Replication**: Copies data across nodes for redundancy (e.g., GFS replicates chunks 3x).

- **Consistency Models**:
    - **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data instantly (e.g., databases).
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Data converges to consistency over time (e.g., HDFS).

- **Fault Recovery**: Automatic recovery via replication and checkpointing.

---

#### **4. Case Studies**

- **Google File System (GFS)**:
    - **Master Node**: Manages metadata (file-to-chunk mapping).
    - **Chunk Servers**: Store 64MB chunks.
    - **Features**: Large block sizes, replication, fault tolerance.

- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**:
    - **NameNode**: Maps file names to block locations.
    - **DataNodes**: Store blocks.
    - **WORM Model**: Write Once, Read Many.

---

#### **5. Name Services**

- **Definition**: Maps human-readable names (e.g., domain names) to resources (e.g., IP addresses).

- **Examples**:
    - **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) to IP addresses.
    - **HDFS NameNode**: Maps file names to block locations.
    - **CORBA Naming Service**: Maps object names to references in distributed systems.

- **Requirements**: Scalability, fault tolerance, hierarchical naming, and trust management.

---

#### **6. Name Resolution Techniques**

- **Hierarchical Resolution**:
    - Structured, step-by-step resolution (e.g., DNS: root → TLD → authoritative server).

- **Iterative Resolution**:
    - Client/resolver queries servers step-by-step (e.g., DNS resolver gets referrals).
    - **Advantages**: Load distribution, decentralized, caching.

- **Recursive Resolution**:
    - Resolver handles all queries (client receives final answer).
    - **Advantages**: Simplified client interaction, faster responses, reduced root server load.
