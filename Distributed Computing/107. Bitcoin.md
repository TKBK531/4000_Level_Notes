### **📌 Abstract**

**Summary**: Bitcoin proposes a **peer-to-peer electronic cash system** that eliminates the need for trusted third parties (e.g., banks). It solves the **double-spending problem** using a **proof-of-work (PoW)** mechanism, where transactions are recorded in a public ledger (blockchain). The longest chain of blocks represents the valid history, as it requires the most computational effort to create.

**Key Points**:

- 🔹 **No intermediaries**: Payments are direct between parties.
    
- 🔹 **Double-spending prevention**: Achieved via PoW and decentralized consensus.
    
- 🔹 **Security**: Honest nodes must control >50% of CPU power to outpace attackers.

### **📌 1. Introduction**

**Problem**: Traditional e-payments rely on **trusted third parties**, leading to:

- 🚫 **Fraud risks**: Reversible transactions create disputes.
    
- 🚫 **High costs**: Mediation fees limit small transactions.
    

**Solution**: Bitcoin replaces trust with **cryptographic proof**:

- 🔒 **Irreversible transactions**: Protect sellers.
    
- ⛓ **Decentralized ledger**: Prevents double-spending via majority consensus (honest nodes > attackers).

### **📌 2. Transactions**

**How Bitcoin Works**:

- A "coin" is a **chain of digital signatures** (each owner signs the previous transaction + next owner’s public key).
    
- ❌ **Double-spending risk**: Without a central authority, payees can’t verify if coins were spent earlier.
    

**Solution**:

- 📢 **Public announcements**: All transactions are broadcast.
    
- 🕵️ **Consensus**: Nodes agree on the order of transactions (first-seen rule).
    

---

### **📌 3. Timestamp Server**

**Purpose**: Orders transactions chronologically.

- ⏳ **Method**: Hashes of transaction blocks are published (e.g., in newspapers).
    
- 🔗 **Chain effect**: Each timestamp includes the prior one, creating an immutable history.
    

---

### **📌 4. Proof-of-Work (PoW)**

**Core Innovation**:

- ⛏ **Computational puzzle**: Nodes compete to solve a hash with leading zeros (requires brute-force CPU work).
    
- 🔐 **Security**: Altering a block requires redoing all subsequent blocks + outpacing honest nodes.
    
- 📊 **Fair voting**: "One CPU = one vote" prevents Sybil attacks (no IP-based manipulation).
    

**Difficulty Adjustment**:

- 🎯 Auto-adjusted to maintain ~10-minute block intervals.

### **📌 5. Network**

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Broadcast**: Transactions sent to all nodes.
    
2. **Block creation**: Nodes collect transactions + solve PoW.
    
3. **Validation**: Nodes accept blocks only if transactions are valid.
    
4. **Chain extension**: Nodes work on the longest chain (consensus mechanism).
    

**Handling Conflicts**:

- If chains split, the longest one wins (ties resolved later).
    

---

### **📌 6. Incentive**

**Miners’ Rewards**:

- 💰 **Block reward**: New coins created for the miner (like gold mining).
    
- 💸 **Transaction fees**: Optional fees incentivize miners long-term.
    

**Honesty Encouraged**:

- 🏆 Attackers lose more by cheating than by following rules (profitable to stay honest).
    

---

### **📌 7. Reclaiming Disk Space**

**Optimization**:

- 🗑 **Discard old transactions**: Spent transactions are pruned.
    
- 🌳 **Merkle Trees**: Only root hashes are stored in blocks, saving space.
    

**Storage Estimate**: `~4.2MB/year` for block headers (feasible long-term).

---

### **📌 8. Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)**

**Lightweight Clients**:

- 📱 Users verify payments without full nodes (store only block headers).
    
- ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Relies on honest majority; attackers can fool SPV temporarily.
    

---

### **📌 9. Combining/Splitting Value**

**Flexible Transactions**:

- 🔢 **Multiple inputs/outputs**: Like combining small bills or receiving change.
    
- 🔄 **No full history needed**: Only relevant transaction branches are tracked.
    

---

### **📌 10. Privacy**

**Pseudonymity**:

- 🎭 **Anonymous public keys**: Addresses aren’t tied to identities (like stock exchange tapes).
    
- 🔄 **New keys per transaction**: Limits traceability (except for multi-input transactions).
    

---

### **📌 11. Calculations (Attacker Success Probability)**

**Gambler’s Ruin Analogy**:

- 📉 Probability an attacker catches up drops **exponentially** as honest chain grows.
    
- Formula: `q_z=(q/p)^z (if p>qp>q)`.
    

**Safety Threshold**:

- Example: For `q=0.1`, wait **6 blocks** `(P<0.1%)` to confirm transactions.
    

---

### **📌 12. Conclusion**

**Key Achievements**:

- 🏛 **Trustless system**: No banks or intermediaries.
    
- ⚡ **Decentralized security**: PoW + majority consensus.
    
- 🌐 **Robustness**: Nodes join/leave freely; minimal coordination needed.
    

**Final Note**: Bitcoin’s rules/incentives are enforced by **consensus** (CPU power voting).
